Photorealistic rendering attempts to make an image indistinguishable from a photograph. Non-photorealistic rendering (NPR), also called stylized rendering, has a wide range of goals. One objective of some forms of NPR is to create images similar to technical illustrations. Only those details relevant to the goal of the particular application are the ones that should be displayed. For example, a photograph of a shiny Ferrari engine may be useful in selling the car to a customer, but to repair the engine, a simplified line drawing with the relevant parts highlighted may be more meaningful (as well as less costly to print).

真实感渲染试图使图像与照片无法区分。非真实感渲染（NPR）也称为风格化渲染，具有广泛的目标。 某些类型的NPR目标是创建类似于技术插图的图像。只有那些与特定应用程序目标相关的细节才应显示。例如，发亮的法拉利发动机的照片可能有助于将汽车出售给客户，但要修理发动机，用突出显示相关零件的简化线图可能更有意义（并且打印成本更低）。

Another area of NPR is in the simulation of painterly styles and natural media, e.g., pen and ink, charcoal, and watercolor. This is a huge field that lends itself to an equally huge variety of algorithms that attempt to capture the feel of various media. Some examples are shown in Figure 15.1. Two older books provide coverage of technical and painterly NPR algorithms [563, 1719]. Given this breadth, we focus here on techniques for rendering strokes and lines. Our goal is to give a flavor of some algorithms used for NPR in real time. This chapter opens with a detailed discussion of ways to implement a cartoon rendering style, then discusses other themes within the field of NPR. The chapter ends with a variety of line rendering techniques.
